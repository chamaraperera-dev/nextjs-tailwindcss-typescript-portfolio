# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The website showcases my personal projects and provides information about my skills and experience. It also features a contact form that allows visitors to send messages directly to my email using Nodemailer.

The website includes a dark mode that can be toggled on and off using a button in the header.

## Deployment

The website is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed at [https://chamaraperera.dev](https://chamaraperera.dev).
